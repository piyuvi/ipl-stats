This VueJs webapp is to display IPL data across the seasons using the dataset provided. The ball by ball analysis is also shown for every match across all overs under the 'Show Details' option of every match.

The external libraries used are-

1. BootStrap Vue - The reason for using specifically Bootstrap Vue is that it provides a large number of components like                           navtabs, table, pagination etc.

2. vue-highcharts - To render and display the chart for ball by ball analysis.

3. vue-spinner - To add the loader while the page renders completely.

4. Papa parse - To parse the csv files.

5. moment - To display the dates in desired format.

The bonus points been taken care of are-

1. Built in VueJS.

2. Optimized the loading time by loading the csv files only once during page init.

3. Mobile Responsive , most of it was taken care by using bootstrap framework.

4. Progressive webapp and offline available by leveraging service workers.
